Phishing Detection Project
Introduction
This project aims to detect phishing websites using machine learning classifiers. Phishing websites attempt to deceive users into disclosing sensitive information such as login credentials, financial details, or personal information. By employing various machine learning algorithms, this project helps identify such malicious websites to safeguard users' security and privacy.

Models Used
Four different classifiers were employed in this project to detect phishing websites:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes Classifier
Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the classifiers consists of features extracted from URLs and website content, along with labels indicating whether the website is phishing or legitimate. The dataset was sourced from [insert dataset source here].

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Run the main script or notebook to train the classifiers and evaluate their performance.
Optionally, you can use pre-trained models provided in the repository for prediction on new datasets.
File Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
models/: Contains saved models after training.
src/: Contains source code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
requirements.txt: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.
Running the Code
To run the code, follow these steps:

Navigate to the project directory.
Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Execute the main script or notebook.
Results
After training the classifiers, the performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are reported for each model. Additionally, confusion matrices may be provided to visualize the classification results.

Future Work
Fine-tuning model parameters for improved performance.
Exploring ensemble methods for better classification accuracy.
Incorporating additional features or data sources for enhanced phishing detection.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest improvements. Happy coding!
